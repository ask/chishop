PyPI feature replication
========================

* Make it possible to register users via distutils.
  There should be a setting to turn this feature on/off for private PyPIs.

* Roles (co-owners/maintainers)
    - One possible solution:
            http://github.com/initcrash/django-object-permissions/tree
    I'm not sure what the difference between a co-owner and maintainer is,
    maybe it's just a label.
* Package author admin interface (submit, edit, view)
* Search
* Documentation upload
* Ratings
* Random Monty Python quotes :-)
* Comments :-)

Post-PyPI
=========

* PEP-381: Mirroring infrastructure for PyPI
    [taken-by: jezdez]

* API to submit test reports for smoke test bots. Like CPAN Testers.
  Platform/version/matrix etc.

* Different listings: Author listings, classifier listings, etc.

* Search metadata

* Automatic generation of Sphinx for modules (so you can view them directly
on pypi, like CPAN), Module listing etc.

* Listing of special files: README, LICENSE, Changefile/Changes, TODO,
    MANIFEST.

* Dependency graphs.

* Package file browser (like CPAN)




Documentation
=============

* Write a tutorial on how to set up the server, registering projects, and
  how to upload releases.
